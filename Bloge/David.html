<h1>David Hillhouse Buel</h1>

<p class="quote">David Hillhouse Buel, Jr. (July 19, 1862 – May 23, 1923) was an American priest
 who served as the president of Georgetown University. He was a Catholic priest and
 Jesuit for much of his life, but later left the Jesuit order to marry, and 
subsequently left the Catholic Church to become an Episcopal priest. Born at Watervliet Arsenal in
 New York, he was the son of David Hillhouse Buel, a distinguished Union Army officer,
 and descended from numerous prominent New England families who were among the earliest
 colonial settlers of the United States. While studying at Yale University, he was introduced
 to Michael J. McGivney, a priest at St. Mary's Church, and converted to Catholicism,
 entering the Society of Jesus after graduation.</p>

<p>In 1901, Buel became a professor at Georgetown University. He took charge of the
 university in 1905, after the sudden removal of the president. In this role, he promoted
 intramural sports, oversaw construction of Ryan Gymnasium, and reformed the curriculum
 and university governance. He also instituted strict discipline and curtailed intercollegiate
 athletics, stoking fierce opposition from the student body and their parents, which resulted 
in his removal by the Jesuit superiors in 1908. Buel then performed pastoral work and taught
 for several years, before resigning from the Jesuit order in 1912 and secretly marrying in
 Connecticut. When word reached Washington, D.C., his former Jesuit colleagues publicly 
condemned him, and the media claimed his actions resulted in his excommunication latae
 sententiae.</p>

ancestry includes several prominent and influential families, such as the McDougalls, Hansons,
 Wilmers and Hillhouses,[3] the latter of which produced many statesmen and scholars in Connecticut.

 His earliest American ancestor, William Buel, arrived in 1630 from England.[2] Two of Buel's brothers,
 Samuel and Clarence, went on to become Episcopal priests.[8]
